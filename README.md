This is my first github repository so sorry in advance if I am missing anything
uses openai prompt to extract 2 main colors from an image source
needs an openai key(paid) but is very cost effective vs manually doing it
does require some form of unique image id so it can assign the colors to the right product
the images need to be in  a white/transparent background or the code needs to be changed accordingly
the current requirement for a color to be selected is 15% of image needs to be in that color
